    <h1>10 Rules of Studying Every Software Developer Should Follow</h1>

    <p>
    <h3>Recall what you’ve just learned</h3>
    After going through a chapter or coding exercise, do something else and remember the main ideas of what you learned.

    Try recalling them when you are doing mundane activities like doing the dishes, going out to the store, or taking a
    shower.

    The ability to recall new things you learned will help you cement them in your mind much more easily.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Actually write the code</h3>
    Imagine you are watching an awesome Laravel tutorial on YouTube.

    Now you’re already 2 hours in and can’t remember how the author got the database connection up and running.

    Now you have to go back to that specific section and re-watch it.

    What a waste of time!

    Write out the code as you go along with the tutorial you are watching or reading. If you cannot keep up with the
    pace, press pause, solve the issue or coding challenge, and then resume the video.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Chunk the ideas and problems</h3>
    The idea of chunking is to understand and practice with an idea or solution to a problem to the point where you can
    recall it in a split second.

    Once you have learned a new programming concept, take some time to repeat it. Imagine a song about it and try to
    sing it in your mind over and over again.

    The information will turn into a chunk and you will be able to make a connection and pull it up whenever you want.
    </p>

    <h3>Train your mind like you would train your body</h3>
    If you want to build muscle, you will need to train your body a little bit every day.
    But you wouldn’t want to train just one muscle group 7 days a week. It will not grow as much as you would like it
    to. Muscles need time to grow. The tissues need time to regenerate and grow in mass.

    So one solution is to split your workout into muscle groups. On day one you train legs and abs, day two the chest,
    day three the back, and day four maybe the arms.

    That’s what you should do when you learn.

    Spread out your learning a little every day, just like a bodybuilder. The brain is like a muscle – it can handle
    only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time.

    Try to split your learning routine into something similar to muscle groups:

    Database management day (SQL/NoSQL)
    REST API day
    Web Design day
    Functional JavaScript day
    </p>
    <p>
    <h3>Mix up different problem-solving techniques</h3>
    There is no one single way of solving a problem, that’s for sure. When you have a task and your way of solving the
    problem doesn’t seem to work very well, try a different approach.

    Mix things up and see if you can come up with multiple solutions.

    After every solution you have implemented, go over your errors and make sure you understand why you made them. Then,
    work on improving the code.
    </p>

    <p>
    <h3>Take breaks</h3>
    From my experience, it is common to be unable to solve problems or grasp concepts the first time you encounter them.

    Sometimes you get frustrated that you've been stuck on a problem for so long, and it seems like you cannot figure it
    out. This is the ideal moment to take a break.

    Let your mind relax for a while. You’ll find out that sometimes the solution to your problems comes in your sleep,
    or when taking a bath.

    This is because a part of your mind is working in the background, figuring out things you might not be able to when
    you're focused
